Steve Ramsay of the Secret Service said those charged sold access codes for $80 to $150 a month. An access code -- a telephone credit card number-- allows callers to A Heading use long-distance phone lines.</p>

        people, Ramsey said. Charged to one number in four days: $73,592.  According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Godbey: Computers were programmed to call the companies' long distance networks, then enter a creditcard number to pay for the call. If the number was rejected, the computer kept dialing until one was accepted. The successful number then was sold. whoever was assinged the number, got the bill. "It was the miracle of technology,the computer took a simple chore and did it over and over and over," he said.</p>
