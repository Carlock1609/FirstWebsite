        <p>HONOLULU-- It was high-tech <strong>>robbery -- the theft</strong> and sale of
        long-distance telephone service. Seventeen people in 13 states were arrested Monday. <br/><br/>The charge: conspiracy to commit access device fraud and wire fraud. The victims: U.S. Sprint, <b>>MCI Corp</b>., Allnet Corp.,ITT, Tri-Tel Communications. Their loss: a reported $125 million in the past year. Steve Ramsay of the Secret Service said those charged sold access codes for $80 to $150 a <em>month</em>. An access code -- a telephone credit card number-- allows callers to
        </p>

        <p>use long-distance phone lines. <i>Calls were billed to that card number.</i>
        The distributors often sold one code to hundreds, maybe thousands of
        people, Ramsey said. Charged to one number in four days: $73,592.  According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Godbey: Computers were
        programmed to call the companies' long distance networks, then enter a
        creditcard number to pay for the call. If the number was rejected, the computer kept dialing until one was accepted. The successful number then was sold.
        </p>

        <p>whoever was assinged the number, got the bill. "It was the miracle of technology,the computer took a simple chore and did it over and over and over," he said.
        The Secret Service caught them by setting up their own distributorship of illegal numbers -- a "sting operation" -- and "making controlled diliveries," Ramsey said.
